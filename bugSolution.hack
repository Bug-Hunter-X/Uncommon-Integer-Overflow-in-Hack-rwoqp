This solution includes error handling to explicitly check for potential integer overflows in each function before performing the arithmetic operation. If an overflow is detected, an exception is thrown.  This prevents the program from producing incorrect results due to the overflow.  Furthermore, more robust error handling could be added to prevent unexpected behavior in production scenarios.  It's recommended to handle potential exceptions gracefully to ensure program stability.
